# python_project_gym

This is my Week 5 Python solo project. It is a gym app designed to be used by gym employees to create and edit members and classes within a gym.

To run this application, clone the repository and type "flask run" into the terminal. Then follow the link provided and this should take you to the app.

The app home page will take you to the primary two branches of the app, Members and Classes.<img width="1360" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-14 at 09 03 28" src="https://github.com/ewanlaing/python_project_gym/assets/117400398/eda532c8-6c1a-472b-a263-f31d206d8033">

Selecting either one of these will take you to a list of all the relevant data, with options to book members into classes, or edit and add classes or gym members.

Selecting the name of the gym member or class will take you to the view page, where the option to make changes will be available.<img width="1184" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-14 at 09 06 14" src="https://github.com/ewanlaing/python_project_gym/assets/117400398/eef878bd-3c5d-403e-bacd-21af6e6f3396">
